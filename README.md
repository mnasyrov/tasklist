This is a proof-of-concept for building React app without Redux.

Following tools are used:

- [JetState](https://github.com/mnasyrov/jetstate) - Reactive state management with RxJS.
- [react-ioc](https://github.com/gnaeus/react-ioc) - Hierarchical Dependency Injection with new React 16 Context API.

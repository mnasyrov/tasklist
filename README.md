# TaskList App

A simple task list.

This is a proof-of-concept for building React app without Redux.

Following tools are used:

- [Akita](https://github.com/datorama/akita) - State Management Tailored-Made for JS Applications.
- [react-ioc](https://github.com/gnaeus/react-ioc) - Hierarchical Dependency Injection with new React 16 Context API.
- [immer.js](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) - It is a tiny package that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way. It is based on the copy-on-write mechanism.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
